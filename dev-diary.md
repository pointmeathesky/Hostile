Week 5
Goals: Focus on the post component. Get the component to create a post to a place I'm happy with. Change how posts show up in the feed, add replies to posts.

Hours: I plan to spend 15-20 hours on this 

04/28 - 3 hours, worked on the post page, trying to improve its appearance and exploring using a modal instead 


to do:

posts:

    []show just the post title and have users click on the post to expand to show the body, allow users to make comments on posts
    []add a way for users to delete their posts
    []redesign the page to make a post/ have the post creation be a modal instead of a separate page


security issues:

    [X]logging in with a username that doesn't exist
    [X]deleting an account that has made posts
    [X]minimum password length
    [X]Password verification
    [] limited login attempts



- make a bullettin board

- fix ssl issues, I originally set the ssl certificate up for a different domain and did a very lazy job adding in the hostile domain which is causing users to get a security warning when they visit the site

- get rid of forced color inversion and changed icons.

- User Account customization- profile pictures, text color, site color scheme(?)

- Have log in error messages show up on the log in page instead of a new page where the user then has to go back
